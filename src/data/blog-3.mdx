# Water is Your Best Friend

Water is the essence of life, covering 70% of the Earth's surface and making up about 60% of the human body. Every living organism depends on water for survival, and it is crucial for our day-to-day activities. As a general rule of thumb, a person can survive without water for only three days. Such is the importance of water!

## The Benefits of Drinking Water

Water is not just a thirst-quencher; it is vital for our overall health and well-being. Proper hydration is essential for:

- **Skin Health:** Drinking water rehydrates the skin, enhancing its health and beauty. It helps to maintain the elasticity of the skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and other signs of aging.
- **Body Temperature Regulation:** Water plays a critical role in regulating body temperature, especially during hot weather or physical activity.
- **Detoxification:** Water flushes out toxins and waste products from the body, aiding in digestion and promoting kidney function.
- **Physical Performance:** Staying hydrated is key to maintaining physical performance, as dehydration can lead to fatigue, reduced endurance, and impaired concentration.
- **Joint and Muscle Health:** Water lubricates joints and cushions muscles, reducing the risk of cramps and injuries.

## The Ayurvedic Perspective on Water Drinking

Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, offers unique insights into the proper way to drink water. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Drink Water Only When Thirsty:** According to Ayurveda, drinking water only when you feel thirsty helps in maintaining the balance of the body's doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha).
2. **Drink Water in a Sitting Position:** Drinking water while sitting, rather than standing, helps prevent bloating and allows for better absorption.
3. **Avoid Drinking Water Directly from a Vessel:** Pouring water from a distance into your mouth can lead to aspiration and may not provide the satisfaction of drinking directly from a glass. It is recommended to drink water by touching the vessel to your lips.
4. **Mind the Quantity:** The recommended daily water intake is between 0.5 to 2.5 liters, depending on various factors like climate, geographical location, and the type of work you do. In hotter climates or for those engaged in strenuous activities, the water requirement might be higher.

## The Healing Power of Medicated Water (Siddha Jal)

Ayurveda also emphasizes the use of medicated water, known as Siddha Jal, for specific health conditions:

- **Urinary Calculus (Kidney Stones):** Drinking water infused with coriander and cumin seeds is beneficial for those suffering from urinary calculus. These ingredients help in dissolving stones and promoting their passage.
- **Fever:** For those suffering from fever, Shadangodak, a herbal water prepared with six herbs, is recommended. It helps in reducing fever and restoring balance in the body.

## Conclusion

Water is a fundamental need of our body, and drinking it in the proper amount, at the right intervals, and in the correct manner is crucial for maintaining a healthy life. Embrace these Ayurvedic practices to enhance the benefits of water and achieve overall well-being.
